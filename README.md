Jonathan Taylor Tuner

An experiment is using the Web Audio API to detect pitch for image manipulation (i.e. databending).

From a high level, the goal is to utilize some sort of pitch detection algorithm to determine the distance in frequency from a target pitch, and use the difference in tuneto modify the raw data of a photo. The hypothesis is that if the pitch is correct, the image will not change at all. 

TL;DR can you use photos of Jonathan Taylor Thomas to tune your guitar?
