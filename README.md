Jonathan Taylor Tuner

Q: Can we use the former teen heartthrob Jonathan Taylor Thomas to help tune our instruments?
A: We can certainly try.

Hypothesis: Using [databending](github.com/mvattuone/webaudio-databend), we can use the interval ratio of instrument and tuning frequencies, converted to cents, to detune an image and visualize how out of tune our instrument is.
